```bash
  git add .
```

Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

```bash
  git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

### Pushing Changes
Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Creating a Pull Request
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button next to your branch
3. Fill out the pull request template with a clear description of your changes
4. Submit the pull request and wait for feedback from the maintainers

## Code Formatting and Style Guidelines
### General Formatting Rules
   - Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
   - Ensure all files end with a newline.

### Java Code Style
- Follow the Google Java Style Guide for Java code.
- Use camelCase for variable and method names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
- Always include Javadoc comments for public classes, methods, and fields.
- Use @Override annotations for overridden methods.
- Don't use Java POJO, use Kotlin data classes instead.

### Kotlin Code Style
- Follow the Kotlin Coding Conventions.
- Use data class for simple data structures.

Maven and Build Configuration
Keep the pom.xml file clean and well-organized.

Use the provided Maven plugins for formatting and static analysis.

Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with Java 11.

Testing
Write unit tests for all new functionality using JUnit 5.

Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request:

bash
Copy
mvn test
Use descriptive test method names that explain the purpose of the test.

Code Review Process
After submitting a pull request, the maintainers will review your changes.
